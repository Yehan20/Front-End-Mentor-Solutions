## My process
Started from mobile first css, analyzed the design and broke it into html components and designed them seperately. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex box
- Mobile-first workflow




### What I learned

I got a refresher of flex box and mobile first css , i didn't do a lot of html and css these days so it was good exercise for me
